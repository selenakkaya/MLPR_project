# MLPR_GenderDetection

In this study, ’synthetic speaker embeddings that represent the acoustic characteristics of a spoken utterance’ is analyzed and a gender classification task is applied by building commonly used machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the performances of applied machine learning models and the comparison of models are analyzed.

## Problem Overview
The data-set contains synthetic speaker embeddings which represent the acoustic characteristics of a spoken utterance. Each row corresponds to a different speaker and contains 12 features followed by the gender label: \\ 1: female, \\ 0: male \\
The features do not have any particular interpretation. Speakers belong to four different age groups. The age information, however, is not available. The training set consists of 3000 samples for each class, whereas the test set contains 2000 samples for each class.
